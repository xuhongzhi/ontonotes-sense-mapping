# Annotation of Chinese Word Senses with English WordNet3.1
This dataset includes annotations of word senses for Chinese words in context (sentences) on the usage examples from OntoNotes 5.0 Chinese sense inventories. Each example is originally used as an usage exmaple for a defined sense of a Chinese lemma. The lemma is then annotated directly with a English WordNet (v3.1) synset. Each lemma with the example it is from is double annotated and for disagreed ones, a final decision is made by a third annotator.


# To Use the Data
Due to licensing issues, the original Chinese sentence with target lemma is not not included. The lemma can be indicated by the file name and the sentences are indicated by line number in the corresponding file, which you can find in the OntoNote 5.0 Chinese sense inventories.
